# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- The project is a plugin for SimHub, which is a racing simulator dashboard software. The plugin should integrate seamlessly with SimHub's existing architecture and follow its conventions.
- The project is written in C# targeting .NET Framework 4.8, so the code should be compatible with that framework and utilize its features effectively.
- Visual Studio 2026 is the primary development environment.
- The function DataUpdate is called at 60 frames per second, so it should be optimized for performance and avoid heavy computations or blocking operations.
